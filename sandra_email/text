Hi all!

 

I am happy to attach the AUDIT scores for UKB participants (in the order of the manifesto – but please check that the age and sex match with the IDs)!

 

In audit_scores.csv you can find:

Age at recruitment and sex (so that you can confirm that the order of the participants is correct)
13 alcohol traits derived from the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT)
The first 10 are individual item responses for items 1 to 10.
The remaining 3 are composite scores for AUDIT-C (“alcohol consumption”, sum of items 1-3), AUDIT-P (“problematic alcohol use”, sum of items 4-10), and AUDIT total score (sum of items 1-10). The composite scores are log10 transformed, as we have done in our previous papers (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33985350/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30336701/ ), to approximate a normal distribution.
How we created these phenotypes is described in AUDIT-Calculation-UKB.ipynb
 

Please let me know if I can help any further – I look forward to working with you on this project! So exciting!

 

Best wishes,

 

Sandra
